### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Bioinformatic scientist with a Master's and PhD in Genetics/emphasis in bioinformatics. Here you can find a small sample of my projects, however most of them are private (I will probably change this later). You can read a little about what I have worked on my results [webpage](https://leishtargets.github.io/).
